In the healthcare industry, pharmacists play a vital role in ensuring that patients receive
timely, accurate, and safe medication. However, the complexity of managing pharmacy
operations—such as tracking inventory, managing vendor relationships, processing sales
transactions, and monitoring medication expiry dates—presents significant challenges.
Traditional inventory systems often fall short of providing comprehensive oversight and
real-time insights, which can lead to issues such as medication shortages, wastage due to
expired stock, and inefficient transaction handling. These limitations not only affect the
operational efficiency of pharmacies but also risk compromising patient care.
To address these challenges, we introduce TRUSTMED (Targeted Retrieval Utility for
Symptom-based Therapeutic Medication), an integrated database management system
tailored for pharmacy use. TRUSTMED is designed to streamline inventory
management, facilitate vendor coordination, log transactions, and monitor expiry data,
thereby providing pharmacists with a centralized, user-friendly platform to manage
essential aspects of their daily operations. By leveraging modern web development
technologies—React for a responsive front-end, Express for backend functionality, and
MySQL as a robust relational database—TRUSTMED aims to deliver a scalable and
efficient solution. Additionally, the system incorporates targeted retrieval based on
symptom-based medication recommendations, enhancing pharmacists’ ability to quickly
and accurately serve patients' therapeutic needs.
